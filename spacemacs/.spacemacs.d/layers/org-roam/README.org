Newer spacemacs develop version support org-roam which would lead below warning
if you use org-roam layer.

#+begin_example
                - More than one init function found for package org-roam. Previous owner was org,
                  replacing it with layer org-roam.
#+end_example

#+begin_example
   dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
   '(
     org-roam
#+end_example

If you modify/rename this layer to _org-roam

#+begin_example
   dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
   '(
     _org-roam
#+end_example

You would see this warning

#+begin_example
Warnings:
    - More than one init function found for package org-roam. Previous owner was org,
      replacing it with layer _org-roam.
#+end_example

#+begin_example
diff org-roam/packages.el _org-roam/packages.el                                                                                                 (master !?)

Anyway, this layer is not needed since org-roam is supported in org layer in the
spaceamcs develop branch with below setting.

#+begin_example
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(
  (org :variables
       org-enable-roam-support t)))
#+end_example
